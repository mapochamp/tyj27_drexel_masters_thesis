\section{Conclusion}
As DNN model sizes continue to grow and DLAs become more prevalent, it becomes
necessary to remove the software bottlenecks through good programming. We
provide a solution via a memory management technique for scratchpads on an
inter-node level for DLAs.

\section{Future Work}
% graph reconstructor for tiling 
	% graph reconstructor for tiling so that we can do 2spm and 1spm case
% integrate into smaug for more accurate results

% compare with exact ILP solution for graph coloring
% compare to graph coloring heursitcs
% compare to heursitics apporach

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A graph reconstructor to account for tiling so tensors that are
		larger than the SPM will be modelled more accurately than being
		size capped to the SPM size.
	\item Integration and testing into SMAUG or a full compiler extension
		that is interoperable with other computational graph frameworks
	\item Comparing the ILP solution to graph coloring and heursitic
		approaches for the many scratchpad case.
\end{enumerate}
