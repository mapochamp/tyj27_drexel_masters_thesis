Toplib does graph coloring for all the tensors and i'm guessing so does onsram. how tf do you do this on
multiple spms?

toplib does a thing where the partition sizes of the spm is the max(same color tensors)
so its basically register allocation but with heterogenous register sizes.

I guess i can do this with register spilling on 3 spms

Greedy implementation: they don't specify how they color or build the graph but they do
tell you the entire algorthim if you figure that part out. all you know is that its greedy
coloring. ig i can find an implmentation online somehere..
